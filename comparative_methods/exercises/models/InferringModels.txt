Inferring Models of Evolution
Austronesian postmarital residence

In this exercise we'll use multistate data on postmarital residence into scheme to infer a sequential model of evolution. 

This variable in the Ethnographic Atlas has the following coding assignments:

*0 = missing 
*1 = avunculocal 
2 = AMBILOCAL: residence can be with either the kin of husband or wife, fairly even split 
*3 = optionally avunculocal/uxurilocal
*4 = optionally avunculocal/virilocal
5 = MATRILOCAL: residence with matrilineal kin group of the wife 
6 = NEOLOCAL: residence in a place not determined by kin ties of either spouse
*7 = no common residence
8 = PATRILOCAL: residence with patrilineal kin group of the husband
9 = UXORILOCAL: residence with wife / wife's kin 
10 = VIRILOCAL: residence with husband / husband's kin

Note: Matrilocal is a subset of uxorilocal; similarly, patrilocal is a subset of virilocal.

* a small number of societies with these variables have been removed for this demonstration

MULTISTATE CODING

0 = 5/9 uxorilocal
1 = 8/10 virilocal
2 = 2 ambilocal
3 = 6 neolocal
