About the ResDes Data

# -- an_37.trees
There are 37 Austronesian languages and a sample of 500 trees.

# -- resdes.trait
The comparative data consist of two binary-coded traits. 
The first column is the form of postmarital residence: 0 = matrilocality, 1 = patrilocality. 
The second column is the descent system: 0 = matrilineal, 1 = patrilineal. 
You can see these plotted on a consensus tree by opening up rd37.pdf

# -- rd37.pdf
The tips are labelled with two columns of dots indicating the residence and descent system norms for the cultural groups associated with each of the languages. 
Column 1, residence: maroon = matrilocality, blue = patrilocality
Column 2, descent: maroon = matrilineality, blue = patrilineality
