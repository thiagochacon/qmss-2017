Pico is extremely basic, but is often useful when working with Bayes Traits as 
it can resolve problems such as line-break mismatches between PC and Mac or 
different file formats. If your file won't import, open, or run no matter how 
carefully you've checked it, open it in pico and save again.

Using the Pico Editor: A Tipsheet
Abbreviated from http://www.udel.edu/topics/software/general/editors/unix/pico/picotips.html

To create and edit files on a central UNIX server, you can use the text-editing program called
 "pico". Pico is a simple editor in which available options are displayed across the bottom of the screen.

To create or edit a file using pico, at the UNIX prompt (represented by the % character), type

pico filename

and press the ENTER key. Replace filename with the name of the file you want to create or modify.

Some editing options are described below:

^C	Cur Pos	determine where the cursor is in the file
^G	Get Help	go to an online help menu
^J	Justify	justify the text in the entire paragraph
^O	WriteOut	save the text you've written without quitting pico
^R	Read File	include a previously written file in your current text
^T	To Spell	 check the spelling in the file
^V	Next Pg	 move the cursor to the next page of the file
^W	Where is	search for character string patterns
^Y	Prev Pg	 move to the previous page of the file

Getting online help

If you need help while you are working with pico, you can use online help at any point 
by pressing the appropriate "help" option displayed at the bottom of the screen 
(e.g., ^G to "Get Help").
