# Querying the database

## Executing SQL

Now we can inspect the data using SQL queries running `sqlite3 qmss.sqlite` 

```sql
$ sqlite3 qmss.sqlite 
SQLite version 3.8.2 2013-12-06 14:53:30
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM languoids;
18357
```

Notes:
- Statements or queries in SQL are terminated by a `;`.
- While SQL is case insensitive, it is customary to write SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`
  and `WHERE` in uppercase, to clearly distinguish them from identifiers for tables and columns.

You can change some SQLite settings to make the output easier to read. First, set the output mode to display left-aligned columns. Then turn on the display of column headers.

```sql
.mode column
.header on
```


## SELECT

Querying or selecting rows in a table is done using SQL's `SELECT` command, specifying the 
fields you want to retrieve and the name of the table, e.g.

```sql
SELECT glottocode, name, macroarea FROM languoids WHERE level = 'language' LIMIT 5;
```

will return results as follows:

<table>
<TR><TH>glottocode</TH>
<TH>name</TH>
<TH>macroarea</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>aari1239</TD>
<TD>Aari</TD>
<TD>Africa</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>aasa1238</TD>
<TD>Aasax</TD>
<TD>Africa</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>abad1241</TD>
<TD>Abadi</TD>
<TD>Papunesia</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>abag1245</TD>
<TD>Abaga</TD>
<TD>Papunesia</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>abai1240</TD>
<TD>Abai Sungai</TD>
<TD>Papunesia</TD>
</TR>
</table>

We used a `WHERE` clause to filter the set of languoids by a certain value for one field.
While the field descriptions following the `SELECT` keyword specify a filtering of the
fields of result rows, the `WHERE` clause filters result rows from the set of all rows
defined after the `FROM` keyword (and the `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of result rows):

SQL provides keywords and construct to manipulate queries allowing
- [sorting](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/02-sort-dup.html)
- [filtering](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/03-filter.html)
- [calculating of new values](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/04-calc.html)
- [aggregating](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/06-agg.html)
- [combining data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/07-join.html)
some of which we will encounter below when examining the data in our two tables.


## Exploring data

We want to combine information about macroareas from table `languoids` with information about
tones in table `phonemes`.

So let's first examine how the information about macroareas is coded. We use the `DISTINCT` 
keyword to remove duplicate rows from the query results.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT macroarea FROM languoids;
```

reults in 

<table>
<TR><TH>macroarea</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Papunesia</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Africa</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Eurasia</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>South America</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>North America</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Australia</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
</TR>
</table>

So there are 6 macroareas associated with languoids. But does each row have a macroarea coded?
To find out, we need to know a bit about how databases handle 
[missing data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/05-null.html).
A missing value for a field is indicated by `null`, the "null value". To make these values more
easily visible in the terminal, we can set

```sql
sqlite> . nullvalue <null>
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT macroarea FROM languoids;
Papunesia
Africa
Eurasia
South America
North America
Australia
<null>
```

Notes:
- `null` corresponds to `NA` in R.
- `null` is not really a value, though, e.g.
```sql
  sqlite> SELECT count(DISTINCT macroarea) FROM languoids;
  6
  sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM languoids WHERE macroarea = null;
  0
  sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM languoids WHERE macroarea is null;
  60
```

We have used the aggregation function `count` to aggregate information from all rows of the
result set.

We can examine the information about tones in the `phonemes` table in the same way:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT tone FROM phonemes;
0
+
<null>
```

So a phoneme is coded as being associated with tone by a value of `+`.
How many of these are there?

```sql
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM phonemes WHERE tone = '+';
2007
```

In how many languages do they occur?

```sql
sqlite> SELECT count(distinct LanguageCode) FROM phonemes WHERE tone = '+';
526
```

So there are languages with more than one tonal phoneme. We can group phonemes by language
or more precisely by inventory and then count the number of grouped phonemes as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    InventoryID, LanguageCode, LanguageName, count(*) AS tones
FROM 
    phonemes 
WHERE 
    tone = '+' 
GROUP BY 
    InventoryID, LanguageCode
ORDER BY tones DESC LIMIT 5;
```

<table>
<TR><TH>InventoryID</TH>
<TH>LanguageCode</TH>
<TH>LanguageName</TH>
<TH>tones</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>662</TD>
<TD>bfd</TD>
<TD>bafut</TD>
<TD>10</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>1390</TD>
<TD>bwu</TD>
<TD>Buli</TD>

<TD>Nizaa</TD>
<TD>9</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>115</TD>
<TD>tca</TD>
<TD>Ticuna</TD>
<TD>9</TD>
</TR>
</table>

`GROUP BY` can be thought of as process consisting of
- **splitting** the data into groups based on some criteria,
- **applying** a function to each group independently. Typically this function
  aggregates the data in the rows of one group.

To check our assumption that tones are coded with a `+` value for the field `tone`,
we compare this with the [PHOIBLE website](http://phoible.org/inventories):

![PHOIBLE inventories with tones](images/phoible_tones.png)


## Storing intermediate results: VIEW

A convenient way to store intermediate results (in a dynamic way) is via views, which behave
much like tables. You can create a view in SQLite running the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE VIEW tones_by_inventory AS 
    SELECT 
        InventoryID, LanguageCode, LanguageName, count(*) AS tones 
    FROM 
        phonemes 
    WHERE 
        tone = '+' 
    GROUP BY 
        LanguageCode, InventoryID;
```

Note that PHOIBLE may have more than one inventory for an individual language. We can check
whether this is also the case for our view:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM tones_by_inventory;
595
sqlite> SELECT count(distinct languagecode) FROM tones_by_inventory;
526
```

We can aggregate over all inventories for one language, taking the maximal number of tones
coded:

```sql
CREATE VIEW tones_by_language AS 
    SELECT 
        LanguageCode, max(tones) AS tones 
    FROM 
        tones_by_inventory
    GROUP BY 
        LanguageCode;
```

So what do we know about the number of tones per language? We can use a couple more standard
aggregation functions to find out:

```sql
SELECT 
    min(tones), max(tones), avg(tones), sum(tones)/cast(count(tones) AS float) 
FROM 
    tones_by_language;
```

yielding

<table>
<TR><TH>min(tones)</TH>
<TH>max(tones)</TH>
<TH>avg(tones)</TH>
<TH>sum(tones)/cast(count(tones) as float)</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD>
<TD>10</TD>
<TD>3.40684410646388</TD>
<TD>3.40684410646388</TD>
</TR>
</table>

Notes:
- SQLite undertands the usual arithmetic operators `+ - * /` to calculate new values.
- Fields are typed and operators or functions typically do not coerce their arguments into the
  required types. So the `cast` function is used above to make sure we are applying floating
  point division, rather than integer division (with remainder).


## Selecting data from more than one table: JOIN

If we want to compare tone languages with languages without tone, we should include all
other languages present in PHOIBLE giving them a number of tones of `0`. This can be done
using a `JOIN`.

![SQL joins](images/sql_joins.png)

We want to create a result set with one row for each language in `phonemes` and a column giving
the number of tones as `0`, if the language does not appear in `tones_by_language` and
`tones_by_language.tones` else.

So the kind of `JOIN` needed here is a [`LEFT OUTER JOIN`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Left_outer_join):

```sql
SELECT 
    p.LanguageCode, coalesce(t.tones, 0) AS tones
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT LanguageCode FROM phonemes WHERE source != 'upsid') AS p 
LEFT OUTER JOIN
    tones_by_language AS t
ON
    p.LanguageCode = t.LanguageCode;
```

Notes:
- R provides functionality much like `JOIN` via its `merge` function. Setting the `all.x` or
  `all.y` arguments to `T` corresponds to `LEFT` or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`.
- A `LEFT OUTER JOIN` makes sure that the result set contains at least one row for each row
  the left table. If no row matching the `ON` condition can be found in the right table, the
  result row will be filled up with `null`.
- We use the [function `coalesce`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) to select the
  value `0` for a row where `LanguageCode` does not appear in `tones_by_language`, and thus 
  `t.tones` is `null`.
- The result set of a `SELECT` expression behaves much like a table; in particular, it can be
  used in the `FROM` list of another `SELECT` expression.

Since we want to join the result set of the above `SELECT` with the other tables, we put it in
a view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW tones AS
    SELECT 
        p.LanguageCode, coalesce(t.tones, 0) AS tones
    FROM
        (SELECT DISTINCT LanguageCode FROM phonemes WHERE source != 'upsid') AS p 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
        tones_by_language AS t
    ON
        p.LanguageCode = t.LanguageCode;
```


## Joining `languoids` and `phonemes`

We can only merge information from two tables if they have something in common. In our case,
`languoids.isocodes` stores (potentially multiple) ISO codes associated with a languoid, and
`tones.LanguageCode` stores single ISO codes. To match records of the two tables, we have to
further investigate the values in `languoids.isocodes`:

```
sqlite> SELECT max(length(isocodes)) FROM languoids;
3
```

Ok, so there is at most one three-letter ISO code per languoid. Let's see if these ISO codes
are all distinct:

```
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM languoids WHERE length(isocodes) = 3;
7361
```

```
sqlite> SELECT count(distinct isocodes) FROM languoids WHERE length(isocodes) = 3;
7361
```

Good! Having established that `languoids.isocodes` does only hold unique three-letter
ISO codes (or `null`), we can use this field to `JOIN` the two tables:


## Joining `languoids` and `precipitation`

The D-PLACE data is coded for ISO codes as well as for Glottocodes, thus we have two alternatives
for joining. Let's see which one is preferable:

```sql
sqlite> select count(iso_code) from precipitation;
1286
sqlite> select count(distinct iso_code) from precipitation;
1095
sqlite> select count(glottocode) from precipitation;
1618
sqlite> select count(distinct glottocode) from precipitation;
1303
```

Given that there are more than 200 more societies with Glottocodes, we just take "more" as
"better" and go with Glottocodes:

```sql
CREATE VIEW precipitation_by_glottocode AS 
    SELECT 
        glottocode, Language_family, avg(precipitation) AS precipitation
    FROM 
        precipitation 
    WHERE 
        glottocode IS NOT null
    GROUP BY 
        glottocode;
```


Now we can put our dataset together:


```sql
SELECT 
    g.glottocode, g.name, g.macroarea, g.latitude, g.longitude, d.Language_family, d.precipitation, p.tones 
FROM 
    languoids AS g 
JOIN 
    tones AS p 
ON 
    g.isocodes = p.LanguageCode 
JOIN 
    precipitation_by_glottocode AS d 
ON 
    d.glottocode = g.glottocode 
ORDER BY 
    d.Language_family, g.name;
```

<table>

</TR>
</table>

Let's turn this result set into a view and do some initial exploration of this dataset.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dataset AS
    SELECT 
        g.glottocode, g.name, g.macroarea, g.latitude, g.longitude, d.Language_family, d.precipitation, p.tones 
    FROM 
        languoids AS g 
    JOIN 
        tones AS p 
    ON 
        g.isocodes = p.LanguageCode 
    JOIN 
        precipitation_by_glottocode AS d 
    ON 
        d.glottocode = g.glottocode 
    ORDER BY 
        d.Language_family, g.name;  
```

How big is our sample of the world's languages?

```sql
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM dataset;
466
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM dataset WHERE tones > 0;
161
```

Grouping tone languages by macroarea:

```sql
SELECT macroarea, count(*) AS tone_languages FROM dataset WHERE tones > 0 GROUP BY macroarea;
```

Resulting in:

<table>
<TR><TH>macroarea</TH>
<TH>tone_languages</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Africa</TD>
<TD>140</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Eurasia</TD>
<TD>10</TD>

</TR>
<TR><TD>Papunesia</TD>
<TD>1</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>South America</TD>
<TD>2</TD>
</TR>
</table>

So [compared with WALS](http://wals.info/feature/13A?v1=a000) our dataset seems to be a 
reasonable sample.

![WALS - Tone](images/wals-tone.png)

Let's have a first peek at the relation between precipitation and tones:

```sql
sqlite> SELECT avg(precipitation) FROM dataset WHERE tones > 0;
102.076166837901
sqlite> SELECT avg(precipitation) FROM dataset WHERE tones = 0;
118.320957924165
```

Hm. More rain on average for languages without tones.
How does this look broken down to macroareas?

```sql
SELECT macroarea, avg(precipitation) FROM dataset WHERE tones > 0 GROUP BY macroarea ORDER BY macroarea;
```

<table>
<TR><TH>macroarea</TH>

Hm. Languages in North America seem to be a bit of an outlier. 

Anyway, the dataset looks interesting enough to export it to CSV and play around with it
in R!

Notes:
- A standardized query language like SQL allows re-using the same analyses tools with different
  database managers, and even with different relational databases.
- There is no defined default ordering of rows returned by a query. So you should always specify
  an explicit order to make query results replicable.
- The fields or values to be selected as well as the tables or expressions from which to select
  can be aliased using `AS`, to allow referencing from other parts of a query.
- SQL provides a standardized, somewhat portable way to declaratively describe data manipulation.
  In our example, the final query is arguably more readable and maintainable than equivalent
  code in a procedural language like python or R.
